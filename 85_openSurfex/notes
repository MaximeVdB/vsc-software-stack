version = '9_0_0' - this is because (docs) "Caution: the directory and all parent directories MUST NOT contain dots (.) in their names."

DOCS:
"""
before to run an experiment (pgd, prep or offline), you need to type

replace (sed) with real stuff:
-- there are check for stuff like CDF_AUTO which make it compile it's own deps
EBROOTNETCDF
- EBROOTNETCDF/LP64 ???

EBROOTGRIBAPI
EBROOTOPENMPI


potentially (not in place right now) removing all `module load` crap (eb will load it itself) - but right now, let it build it's own dependencies...
- netcdf
- MPT
- intel
- intel-fc-10
- sgi-mpt
- sxf90
- sxmpi
- fortran
- fortran/xlf ???

random hardcoded crap (don't know what it's doing):
    - /opt/intel/fce/10.1.021/bin/ifortvars.sh
    - /usr/local/apps/module/init/sh.in 
    - domain=$(grep .fr /etc/hosts | head -1 )
