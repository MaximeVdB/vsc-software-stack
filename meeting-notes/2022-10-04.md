- attending: Kenneth, Alex, Sam, Robin, Maxime, Balazs
- not attending: Mag, Alexander, Bert? Steven? Ehsan?

### Agenda

- YALES2
    - see https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/32
    - PR @ https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/16345
    - EasyBuild should have support for expanding environment variables at module load time
        - for example:
            - modextravars = {'Y2_PYTHON_EXEC': "foo/${EBROOTPYTHON}/bin/python3"}
            - with support for disabling expanding via "expand_env_vars = False" or using $$
            - + warning when $ is used without curly braces
- AMS
    - see https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/35
    - SM is working on a PR for the easyconfig that is used 
- new Tier-2 cluster @ KUL
    - Intel Icelake + A100 + bigmem partition
    - BH: How's the memory bandwidth?
        - AMD Rome/Milan is very sensitive to core pinning (cfr. OpenFOAM)
    - @ HPC-UGent: setting $OMP_PROC_BIND=1 by default since a couple of months (on Tier-2 clusters + Tier-1 Hortense)
        - but needs to be disabled for some software, like FLUENT, R, PyTorch, ...
            - for R, $OMP_PROC_BIND should NOT be set otherwise it pins itself to a single core at startup, which destroys performance of R libraries using doParallel...
        - required for a specific Linux kernel + because we use non-standard NUMA layout on our AMD systems
        - mympirun also does some magic, especially when "mympirun --hybrid" is used
        - significant differences w.r.t. (default) core pinning between Intel MPI & Open MPI
