### Agenda

- more in depth training session on EasyBuild (hooks, installing Python packages, ...)?
    - framework deep dive => better suited for an open EB call/session
    - some date in Oct'22? => KH will set up a doodle
- feedback on EESSI? need for a dedicated session on EESSI?
    - see introductory talks at EESSI meeting last week https://eessi.github.io/docs/meetings/2022-09-amsterdam
    - just make EESSI available at all VSC sites vs building our own EESSI-like shared software stack from scratch
    - may depend on how easy it is to tweak module files provided by EESSI
    - Robin: any performance impact?
        - GROMACS performance scaling: see EESSI paper (https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.3075, section 6)
            - on-par performance for GROMACS with 16,000 cores with system installation on JUSUF @ JSC
        - TODO:
            - evaluate impact on startup performance for large MPI workloads
            - broader study of performance for various scientific applications
- https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues
    - TELEMAC & openLISEM are being installed on Hortense, quite a bit of effort to get these supported in EasyBuild...
- other topics?
