    - Should we set up our own VSC CVMFS repository to work together on a central software stack for all VSC systems?
    - EESSI should also be available in VUB Hydra as well
    - to get started:
        - ls /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org
        - source /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/versions/2021.12/init/bash
- Software stack on new KUL RHEL8 system
    - Currently software is only installed on demand
    - Only recent toolchains: currently only 2021a toolchains
- For UGent migration to RHEL8
    - As much modules as possible (with moderate effort) were installed
    - Oldest toolchains are foss/2019b + intel/2019b (with some necessary tweaks)
