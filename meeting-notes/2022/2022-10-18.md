- attending: Kenneth, Sam, Alex, Robin, Maxime, Balazs
- not attending: Mag, Alexander, Bert, Steven, Ehsan

### Agenda

- recent issues in https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues
    - sources for cdbtools (https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/44)
- new EasyBuild release soon (this week?)
    - patches for GCC + OpenBLAS to fix failing LAPACK tests (which affect VASP)
        - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/issues/16380
        - patch for GCC 11.x + 12.x to fix vectorizer bug: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/16411
            - also reported upstream, see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=107254
        - so applies to `foss/2021b` + `foss/2022a`
        - OpenBLAS patches (+ enabling running of LAPACK tests): https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/16406
        - in theory, everything build with GCC (and `-ftree-vectorize`) or statically linked to OpenBLAS should be rebuilt
        - "safe" in-place updates of GCC + OpenBLAS could be built via bwrap, something like:
          ```
          bwrap --bind / / --bind /tmp/apps/gent /apps/gent --dev /dev --bind /dev/log /dev/log eb GCCcore-11.3.0.eb -f
          mv /tmp/apps/gent/software/GCCcore/11.3.0 /apps/gent/software/GCCcore/
          # or 'cp', but that's less "atomic"
          ```
    - SYSTEM instead of True in dependency specification
        - https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/16384
    - correctly count number of failing PyTorch tests
        - https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/2794
- Alex has a work-in-progress easyblock for installing Julia packages
- Maxime: EasyBuild approach to deprecation of classic Intel compiler
    - icc + icpc classic compilers will no longer be supported end of 2023 (?)
    - support for 'oneapi' toolchain option was added in EasyBuild, see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/4031/
    - from some Intel version onwards, 'oneapi' toolchain option will be enabled by default
        - opt-out will be possible via toolchainopts = {'oneapi': False}
- RHEL8 Intel MPI issue is fixed, see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/issues/15651
