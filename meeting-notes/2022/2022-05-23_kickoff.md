# VSC Central Software Installation

## Notes kickoff meeting 2022-05-23

### Attendees (+ experience with EasyBuild)

- UGent
    - Kenneth Hoste: EasyBuild lead developer
    - Balazs Hajgato: quite experienced, but now a bit rusty, mostly easyconfigs + tweaking easyblocks
    - Stijn De Weirdt: original creator, no experience anymore, interested in workflow + organisation
    - Ewald Pauwels: no hands-on experience, interested in workflow + organisation
- VUB
    - Samuel Moors: EasyBuild maintainer, easyconfigs + easyblocks
    - Alex Domingo: EasyBuild maintainer, easyconfigs + easyblocks
- KUL
    - Mag Selwa: using EasyBuild, mostly easyconfigs
    - Alexander Vapirev: easyconfigs + modifying easyblocks
    - Ehsan Moravveji: experience with using easyconfigs, easyblocks as inspiration as for manual installs
    - Maxime Van Den Bossche: modifying easyconfigs
    - (excused) Steven Vandenbrande: ???
    - Jan Ooghe: no experience, interested in workflow + organisation
- UH:
    - Geert Jan Bex: easyconfigs/easyblocks, but rusty currently
- UA
    - Franky Backeljauw: some experience with easyconfigs, little bit with easyblocks
    - Engelbert Tijskens: no experience at all on EasyBuild
    - Robin Verschoren: some experience modifying easyconfigs, less with easyblocks (but can tweak if needed)
    - Stefan Becuwe: similar as Robin

### Scope & goals

- work together (more) on central software installations
- *using* (not developing) EasyBuild: composing easyconfigs, leveraging existing generic easyblocks
- avoid duplicate work
- share expertise, help each other where it makes sense
- non-goals:
    - let others do the work for you
    - site-specific customizations that are deemed necessary by a particular site

### Current approach at HPC-UGent

- all software installation requests (Tier-2 + Tier-1 Hortense) come in via form @ https://www.ugent.be/hpc/en/support/software-installation-request
    - no exceptions: if email is sent to hpc@ugent.be, we reply with "please use form"
    - OTRS ticket with all submitted info is created in software requests queue, which is used for communication with user
    - auto-reply that install request was created
    - room for improvement
        - integration with VSC accountpage (to automatically get requester info, like email + VSC account)
        - no easy way to see if software is already supported in EasyBuild
- triage is done by Kenneth + Balazs
    - usually an issue is opened in (private) `eb_inuits` repository for each install request
    - easy version update: may do it ourselves (unless it turns out to be more difficult than anticipated)
    - issues are labeled with priority, expected difficulty
    - some initial guidance info is included in issue: toolchain, easyblock, attention points
    - INUITS consultants pick up on issues
    - weekly call (~1h) with consultants to discuss where they got stuck
    - PRs are opened to central easyconfigs repo, reviewed + merged by Kenneth/Balazs or other EasyBuild maintainer
- central software installation at HPC-UGent
    - using EasyBuild develop branch, updated manually at regular intervals
    - often also installing from open PR (`eb --from-pr`)
    - **this is not ideal** (not keeping track of what's in central software stack + how it was installed)
    - we are looking into ways of improving this: easystack file(s) to keep track of what's installed + automate "deployment" via bot (GitHub app)
- site customizations for HPC-UGent
    - in some places we diverge from what EasyBuild does by default
    - implemented in EasyBuild hooks + using custom easyconfigs that are injected with priority
    - private `hpcugent/software-stack` repo (GitHub UGent)

### Practical

- 2 people max per site, to have focused effort
    - they spent a significant amount of their time on central software installations with EasyBuild
    - UGent: Kenneth + Balazs
    - VUB: Sam + Alex
    - KUL:
    - UA:
- central form for software installation requests
    - triggers support ticket in UGent OTRS queue (site-specific)
    - communication with researcher who requested the installation
    - end goal is to reply with "software is installed, use '`module load XXX`' "
- central (private) GitHub repository (https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack)
    - GitHub issue per software installation request to discuss problems (internally), etc.
    - EasyBuild "experts" (Kenneth, Sam, Alex) can do triage (OTRS -> GitHub issue) + give guided info in issue on which easyblock to use, likely attention points, etc.
    - repo serves as sandbox where work-in-progress easyconfigs can be stored (separate subdir per issue)
    - just push to `main` branch (no PRs)
    - mainly to easily share draft easyconfigs and work together/get help
    - very similar to `eb_inuits` private repository already used by HPC-UGent + INUITS consultants, which is working quite well
    - intention is to open pull request to central easyconfigs repository once easyconfig(s) are working
- weekly (or bi-weekly) meetings to discuss work-in-progress
    - short stand-up meetings: only raise issues, don't try to fix them
    - hard cap to 30m (weekly) or 1h (bi-weekly) in total
- direct way of communicating, for example via EasyBuild (or VSC) Slack

### EasyBuild training session

- strong focus on aspects of EasyBuild relevant to this working group
- not a full EasyBuild tutorial!
- in scope:
    - writing easyconfigs
    - leveraging generic easyblocks
    - GitHub integration (`eb --new-pr` & co)
    - implementing hooks to do site customisations efficiently
- out of scope:
    - implementing easyblocks
    - implementing additional features in EasyBuild framework
    - EasyBuild features not relevant to this working group

### Links

- https://easybuild.io/tutorial/
- https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild-tutorial/2021-lust/implementing_easyblocks/

### Q&A

- mostly easyconfigs-only, not easyblocks
- acceptance policy for easyconfigs
    - works on local VSC site + EasyBuild test bot
        - see for example https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/15443
- build_tools bundle to central easyconfigs
    - M4, Bison, flex, Autotools, make, Ninja, Meson, SCons, ...
- force us of software install request form?
    - right now it's too Ghent specific
    - feedback wanted from others before making it a requirements for people outside of UGent

### Actions items

- set up repo
- plan training
- UA/KUL: pick names
- plan follow-up meeting (end of June/early July)
- create OTRS subqueues
- update install request form to also mention other VSC sites
