- Robin: how to avoid that EasyBuild uses -xHost on AMD systems
    - optarch flag that is used can be controlled (per compiler), see https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Controlling_compiler_optimization_flags.html#setting-architecture-flags-for-different-compilers-via-optarch-compiler-flags-compiler-flags
