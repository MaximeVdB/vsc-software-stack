### Agenda

- significant increase in software installation requests @ UGent
    - overal ticket count: 2019: 1,298 - 2020: 1,552 - 2021: 1,904 - 2022: 2,620
    - 2020: 258 - 2021: 241 - **2022: 376**
    - currently a backlog of ~180 open tickets @ HPC-UGent (Tier-2 + Tier-1)
    - a student intern with basic Linux/Python knowledge was able to resolve ~50% of tickets over summer
        - without having admin access or being able to log into VSC accounts
        - we expect ~+20% if he would have had admin access
    - only partially explained by Hortense, there's more going on...
        - are you also seeing an increase in "easy" tickets?
        - @KUL: large part of tickets can be answered by pointing out to the documentation
    - are other sites seeing this trend too?
    - @KUL: upward trend as well in number of tickets, not clear how steep
    - @VUB: increasing number of tickets, but software install requests are stable over last couple of years
        - 2022: 50% more than in 2021 (but partially due to DC move)
        - some software is installed proactively (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ...)
        - ~90% of requests requires creating a new easyconfig (often just a version bump)
    - would installing everything that EasyBuild supports be a significant help?
    - a way to users request something to be installed that's already installed in EasyBuild
        - could be helpful to get installs in place quickly, can be automated
- EuroHPC project MultiXscale started on 1 Jan 2023
    - one of the goals is to make EESSI stable and ready for production use
    - we hope/expect to make a lot of progress in the next couple of months
    - build-and-deploy bot being developed (https://github.com/EESSI/eessi-bot-software-layer) is an important task
- EasyBuild v4.7.0 released
    - https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Release_notes.html
    - highlights: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/releases/tag/easybuild-v4.7.0
    - running EasyBuild on top of Python 2 is deprecated!
    - includes foss/2022b + intel/2022b toolchain definitions
    - use of Intel oneAPI C/C++ compilers is auto-enabled by default
- trouble with latest scipy: update to easyblock needed
    - due to switch from distutils-based installation to Meson
    - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/2848
- EasyBuild docs being ported to MarkDown
    - preview available at https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild-docs
- problem with GPU not being found when EasyBuild is running test for NAMD
    - turns out this was due not not binding `/dev/nvidia*` with bwrap
- Block easyconfig (dependency for PySCF - see https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/37)
    - correct version is at https://github.com/sanshar/StackBlock (not https://github.com/sanshar/Block, which is an old version)
    - requires (deprecated) C++ bindings of OpenMPI...
    - can be installed without MPI support (only OpenMP), may be good enough for PySCF
- PR for QIIME2 with foss/2022a was stuck due to numba PR
