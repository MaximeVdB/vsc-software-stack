## Sync meeting 2023-03-16 (09:00 CET)

- attending: Alex, Balazs, Steven, Maxime, Mag, Robin
- no attending: Sam

### Agenda

- (Alex) VSC fork of easyconfigs setup
    - based on Git worktrees, allow to check out branches like (sub)directories
    - advantage over just a bunch of subdirectories is that branches can have different rules attached to them to enforce review/testing policies
    - proof-of-concept setup, see https://github.com/lexming/vsc-software-stack
    - next steps:
        - set up 'wip', 'vsc', 'site-*' branches in https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack
        - switch to 'wip' branch, remove 'main' branch
        - extend docs in README (use cases section)
- (Alex) FunGAP almost done (https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/95)
    - record of most dependencies? (178)
- LISEM (https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/25)
    - WIP by Sam
    - dependencies are in place, but running into Windows-specific C++ code...
    - see also discussion on running LISEM on Linux: https://github.com/bastianvandenbout/LISEM/discussions/12
- SuiteSparse with intel toolchain requires *a lot* of memory to compile
    - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/17285
    - (Steven) at KUL, ~120GB of memory was used during the installation
    - (Balazs) could try to use `-O1` instead of `-O2`
        - `toolchainopts = {'lowopt': True}` => -O1 for everything
        - or add patch to only compile memory-intensive file to only compile that file with -O1
- Ilastik (https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/62)
    - requires lots of dependencies, incl. TensorFlow 1.14
    - unclear whether it's worth the effort to install it from source
    - should check with Stijn for who this is needed (or why)
