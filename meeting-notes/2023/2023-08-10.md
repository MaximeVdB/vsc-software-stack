# Sync meeting 2023-08-10 (09:00 CEST)

- attending: Kenneth, Sam, Steven, Lara, Robin, Mag, Maxime
    - excused: Alex, Balazs

### Agenda

- EasyBuild v4.8.0 release
    - highlights at https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/releases/tag/easybuild-v4.8.0
    - incl. `foss/2023a` + `intel/2023a` common toolchains (based on GCC 12.3.0)
- latest `Python` (3.11.3 with `GCCcore/12.3.0`) only has minimal set of extensions
    - basically `setuptools`, `pip`, `wheel`
    - most other extensions that used to come with `Python` are now in `Python-bundle-PyPI`
    - some Python packages are now standalone: `poetry`, `hatchling`, `virtualenv`, `setuptools-rust`, `cryptography`
    - graph:

        ```
    - see also https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/18208
    - motivation
        - less (build) dependencies for `Python` itself (like `Rust` that is only required for `cryptography`)
        - leave door open for creating an updated bundle of extensions on top of same Python version
        - allow using multiple different versions of build tools like `poetry`, `hatchling`, etc. as build dependency in other easyconfigs
    - impact on end users can be limit by creating a `Python-bundle` which combines `Python`, `Python-bundle-PyPI`, `SciPy-bundle`, `matplotlib`, etc.
- AlphaPulldown effort
    - see https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/39 + https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/tree/wip/39_AlphaPullDown
- FSL (https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/192)
    - has gone full conda
- QIIME2
    - was done with conda for a while
    - from source install by Sam @ https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/18407
- WEST_Tornado request
    - https://otrsdict.ugent.be/otrs/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketZoom;TicketID=125163
    - Kenneth & Lara will take a look at this together
- medaka (Robin)
    - https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues/188
    - Pysam dep version will need to change
        - you can check with `eb --check-conflicts medaka.eb --robot`
- Delft3d & NonMem (Maxime)
    - required using EasyBuild's support for running interactive commands (run_cmd_qa)
    - PRs coming soon to the appropriate GitHub repos
- new `run` function being implemented to replace `run_cmd` + `run_cmd_qa`
    - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/issues/4252
    - https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/blob/8099f22c36d458cc7c5f440a6f1ca0f1a2143bef/easybuild/tools/run.py#L110
- need for more advanced training on EasyBuild in VSC
    - creating patch files & letting EasyBuild use them, etc.
    - changes in EasyBuild 5.0 (incl. new `run` function)
- Sam: problem on Hortense when post-install patches are used (for FLUENT)
    - fails because of `/readonly` mount, even when using `dodrio-bind-readonly` (https://docs.vscentrum.be/en/latest/gent/tier1_hortense.html#accessing-software-via-readonly-mount-point)
    - should work, bug in `dodrio-bind-readonly`
- Steven: installing licensed software for only a particular group
    - currently changing permissions manually afterwards
    - can use `post_module_hook` to change permissions on module file
    - account used to install software must be a part of the group
        - can consider using `sudo` in `post_permissions_hook` to get around this
    - see https://docs.easybuild.io/hooks
