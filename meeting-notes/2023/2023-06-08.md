### Agenda

- branch setup in vsc-software-stack repo: all done
    - issues @ https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/issues for keeping track of software installation requests across VSC sites
    - `main` branch is deprecated: direct pushes are no longer allowed to it
    - `vsc` branch is default default
        - for software installations that are validated across multiple VSC sites (but can't be pushed upstream to EasyBuild)
        - README with branch setup
        - meeting notes @ https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/tree/vsc/meeting-notes
    - `wip` branch
        - shared by all VSC sites
        - work-in-progress easyconfigs, in a subdirectory corresponding to an issue
        - push directly: no PRs, no CI
    - `site:*` branches
        - one per VSC sites
        - up to VSC site how to manage these, and what to put there
        - staging area for things that could be lifted to `vsc` branch after being tested by other VSC sites
        - VUB is using their `site:vub` branch to collect installed easyconfigs (that are not in EasyBuild (yet))
            - about half of them have a corresponding open PR to central easyconfigs
            - easyconfigs either come from EasyBuild `develop` branch, or `vsc` or `site:vub` branch in `vsc-software-stack` repo
    - workflow with git worktree setup documented at https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack#commits-with-worktrees
    - TODO
        - need a small change in EasyBuild to tell it that `vsc-software-stack` repo can take easyconfig PRs via `--new-pr`
        - GitHub Action for `vsc` branch to test stuff
- EasyBuild v4.7.2 release
    - highlights: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/releases/tag/easybuild-v4.7.2
    - detailed release notes: https://docs.easybuild.io/release-notes
    - GCC 12.3.0 which will serve as base for foss/2023a + intel/2023a (WIP)
        - Python with minimal extensions
        - Python-bundle for better UX
    - AlphaFold 2.3.4, CP2K 9.1 + 2022.1, R-bundle-Bioconductor 3.16
    - 2 new generic easyblocks for installing Rust crates with cargo: `Cargo` and `CargoPythonPackage`
        - pre-download of all source tarballs of requires Rust crates
        - take full control over what gets installed (versions of crates), ensures that installation doesn't break over time
        - example easyconfig @ https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/17595
        - `python -m easybuild.easyblocks.generic.cargo .`  # `Cargo.lock`
    - fix for torchvision easyblock to correctly build with CUDA support
    - use CUDA variant of OpenMM 7.5.1 as dependency for AlphaFold 2.3.0
- EasyBuild v5.0 in development
    - overview of changes being made + planned: https://docs.easybuild.io/easybuild-v5/overview-of-changes/
        - support for Python 2.7 and 3.5 is removed -- Python 3.6+ is required
        - easybuild.tools.py2vs3 module is deprecated
            - table that shows how to modify `import` statements in your custom code @ https://docs.easybuild.io/easybuild-v5/overview-of-changes/#py2vs3
        - TODO
            - enable `use_pip` and `sanity_pip_check` by default in `PythonPackage` easyblock
            - stop relying on `distutils` and `imp` modules in Python std lib (will disappear in Python 3.12)
            - archive easyconfigs using deprecated toolchains (< 2019a)
            - new implementation of `run` function to replace `run_cmd` and `run_cmd_qa`
    - GitHub project board: https://github.com/orgs/easybuilders/projects/18
    - working group on EasyBuild v5.0 (monthly meetings): https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/EasyBuild-5.0-working-group
- Request for feedback from EasyBuild community on planned changes

    - require Lmod v7.x or newer (maybe even v8.x or newer): https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/issues/871
    - toolchain support policy: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/issues/872
        - only accept PRs for N most recent toolchains, deprecate/archive older toolchains, etc.
        - VUB is adopting a similar approach in their module tree
            - modules with older toolchains (2019a) are hidden, and can't be loaded, unless `legacy-software` module is loaded
            - VUB still provides modules built with a 2016a toolchain
            - also partially motivated by performance issues with Lmod due to long $MODULEPATH (one entry per generation of easyconfigs: 2016a, 2016b, etc.)
        - can still use EasyBuild 4.x for installing software with older toolchains
        - in practice not much would change, fixes for old toolchains are already relatively rare
        - a policy like this would allow the EasyBuild maintainers to more actively clean up/close PRs for old toolchains

- Few smaller questions (UAntwerp):
    - We would like to install atools in the 2021a and 2022a toolchains.
      We see `atools-1.4.8-GCCcore-10.3.0-Python-2.7.18.eb` and `atools-1.5.1-GCCcore-11.2.0.eb`. Are we correct in assuming the Python-suffix is due to dependency on the Python 2 module instead of the Python 3?
      So far, "`eb atools-1.5.1-GCCcore-11.2.0.eb --try-toolchain-version=11.3.0 --try-update-deps --experimental`" seems to pick up the right modules.
      - Send in PR for atools-1.5.1-GCCcore-11.3.0.eb
    - Trying to install `QuantumESPRESSO-7.1-foss-2022a.eb`, we notice "`configure: error: git needed`" (no git on the compute nodes we're building on).
      This does not seem to be only the fetch step; some of the external libraries (e.g. FoX) are installed through git submodules.
      Should we send in PRs to add git as build dependency for QuantumESPRESSO, or keep this in a local hook?
      - Makes sense to add this as build dependency, send in PRs for past few toolchains
