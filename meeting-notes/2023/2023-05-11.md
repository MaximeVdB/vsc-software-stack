- attending: Kenneth, Balazs, Robin, Mag, Alex, Steven, Sam, Maxime
- no attending: ?

### Agenda

- branch setup in vsc-software-stack repo
    - keep 'wip' branch as default (most active)
    - 'vsc' branch for production stuff that can't go to central easyconfigs repo
    - site branches: site-ugent, site-vub, site-ua, site-kul
    - README should go in all branches (and be kept in sync)
        - see README in 'vsc' branch
    - top of README can have short description on what branch is intended for
- easystack files + use bot to build & deploy
    - UGent plans to keep track of software stack in easystack files - see https://docs.easybuild.io/easystack-files
    - cfr. EESSI bot being developed - https://eessi.github.io/docs/meetings/2022-09-amsterdam/EESSI-community-meeting-2022.09-015-status-build-deploy-bot.pdf
- running easyconfig tests in 'vsc' branch
    - GitHub Action workflow to copy 'vsc' branch on top of central 'develop' branch + run test suite
- EasyBuild v4.7.2 release soon
    - will include new generic easyblocks for Rust software
    - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/2902
    - easyconfigs using this:
        - bamtofastq: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/17595
        - Longshot: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/17666
- Why is there no FFTW.MPI easyconfigs for intel toolchain?
    - in foss:
        - FFTW with GCC toolchain + FFTW.MPI with gompi toolchain
    - in intel (currently):
        - only FFTW with iimpi toolchain (incl. FFTW MPI routines)
        - we could have FFTW with intel-compilers toolchain + FFTW.MPI with iimpi toolchain
    - graph of toolchains and subtoolchains is being added to EasyBuild docs, see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-docs/pull/149/files#r1189519923
- KUL is upgrading Genius to Rocky 8, would like to keep 2018a + 2019b (+ 2021a) toolchains
    - will be painful, especially for intel/2018a
    - there may be some trouble with OpenMPI 3.x?
        - out-of-memory problem with OpenFOAM on top of OpenMPI 3.x, dies with core dump
    - effort already done by KUL, could be useful to others?
        - would be nice if this is shared in site-kul branch in vsc-software-stack
    - UGent also has some workarounds for RHEL8 in private 'software-stack' repo that could be shared via site-ugent branch in vsc-software-stack
        - in `intel/2019b` and `intel/2020a`, bump to newer impi:
        ```
        # custom impi version for iimpi/2019b on RHEL8 (standard iimpi/2019b has impi 2018.5.288),
        # because mpirun provided by impi 2018.5.288 crashes during sanity check ("EXIT CODE: 11" => segfault?);
        # impi 2019.7.217 works for most stuff, but fails with "pthread_mutex_destroy: Device or resource busy"
        # for some stuff, like Theano, netcdf4-python
        ('impi', '2019.9.304', '', ('iccifort', local_compver)),
        ```
    - VUB is also planning to move to Rocky 8
- Results of EasyBuild user survey: https://docs.easybuild.io/user-survey/
    - see OS results @ https://docs.easybuild.io/user-survey/#operating-system
