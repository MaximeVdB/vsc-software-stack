### Agenda

- (Alex) Proposal to create a single VSC repo for easyconfigs
  - motive: whenever there is a new software request it is complicated to know if that easyconfig already exists or if somebody is working on it. Now we have to
    - (VSC fork)
    - navigate upstream repo
    - search open PRs
    - search issues in vsc-software-stack
    - ask Sam politely
  - pushing everything upstream is undoable for multiple reasons:
    - version divergence with upstream repo
    - merging of PRs can stall for long time
    - custom hacks that are too ugly for upstream standards
  - we could simplify our workflow by having a single VSC repo for easyconfigs
    - fork of upstream + all easyconfigs of software installed in VSC clusters
    - ideally nothing should be installed in a cluster if it does not have its easyconfig in this VSC repo
  - current approach at UA
      - fork of upstream easyconfigs repo + separate repo with own easyconfigs (https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen/UAntwerpen-easyconfigs)
  - current approach at KUL
      - no central repo with custom easyconfigs used by KUL
      - contributing back easyconfigs is done via personal forks
  - current approach at UGent
      - private repo with custom easyconfigs/toolchains/hooks (not a full fork)
          - cluster-specific (e.g. AMD CPUs), OS-specific, generic easyconfigs, which get preference over what's included with EasyBuild
      - contributions to upstream are done via personal forks (after testing in personal VSC account)
      - production installations are done using EasyBuild develop branch
      - sometimes using "eb --from-pr ..." (not waiting until PR is merged upstream)
  - current approach at VUB
      - using EasyBuild develop
      - using personal forks to contribute easyconfigs upstream
      - rarely installing from open easyconfig PRs
  - VSC fork could also be a place to share EasyBuild hooks
- UAntwerpen is looking to re-work and update the toolchain, with a possible jump to 2022*b*. Hoping for some advice from other hubs:
    - Expectedly, there can be some applications that are present in 2022a, but missing in 2022b. How should we go about updating those (e.g. version numbers of dependencies/packages)?
        - mostly due to SciPy-bundle https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/16912, blocked by https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/2862
    - What is preferred to install e.g. extra Python/R/... packages: a separate EasyConfig with a bundle, extensions, ...?
    - What is the software install policy in other hubs: install only after user request, or are some packages installed sooner?
        - at UGent: toolchains, Perl, Python + SciPy-bundle, R + Bioconductor, OpenFOAM (+ all required dependencies)
    - Are there any (central) plans for more documentation in the EasyConfigs?
